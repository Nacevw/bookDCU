# bookDCU - Room Booking for DCU Staff and Students
## About Our Project
Our proposed project is to design and build a system that will allow any DCU staff member or student to book a room for a meeting or study, as well as book a seat in a computer lab giving them a space to work on projects, such as third and fourth-year School of Computing projects .
